# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository. See
README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md for how to build, test and contribute.

## Model

The default model for this repository is Sonnet. Switch to Opus only
for architectural decisions with conflicting constraints (design
choices with non-obvious trade-offs, changes spanning many scripts
with unclear dependencies, diagnosis where the symptom does not point
to the cause). Use `/model opus` for the session, then switch back to
Sonnet.

Do not use Fable unless explicitly instructed.
